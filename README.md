About the Pig Game üòç
The Pig Game is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a die and accumulating points. The catch is that if a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points they gained in that turn and their turn ends. They can hold at any time to add their current points to their total score and pass the turn. The first player to reach a target score (usually 100) wins.


How to Play the Pig Game üòç
The Pig Game is a fun and simple dice game where two players take turns rolling a die to score points. The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points.



Game Rules:
1. Rolling the Die: On their turn, a player rolls a six-sided die (showing numbers 1 to 6). If they roll any number from 2 to 6, that number is added to their current turn score. If they roll a 1, they lose all points from this turn, and their turn ends immediately.



2. Holding the Score:
At any time during their turn, a player can choose to "Hold" instead of rolling again. When they hold, their current turn score is added to their total score, and their turn ends. The game then switches to the other player.



3. Winning the Game:
The first player to reach 100 points wins the game. If a player reaches 100 or more points after holding, the game ends immediately, and they are declared the winner!



Game Strategy:
Players must decide whether to take risks by rolling again or play it safe by holding their score. Rolling many times can earn more points, but rolling a 1 means losing everything from that turn!
